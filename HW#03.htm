          Totalitarianism is a country where the government has
          total control over public and private life. The government
          monitored the press, published books, education, and business.
          The government uses propaganda, education, and the press to glorify
          the government or the political leader. The government uses fear to control
          the people and denied their basic rights.  Any opposition that
          demonstrates any opposition towards government policies or beliefs
          would be rooted out. Read how

      <h2>Russia's Agricultural Revolution</h2>
      <p>Historically before any industrial revolution, there needs to be an
        agricultural revolution. Most peasants in Russia were cultivating the
        land as in medieval times. Peasants were
        <a href= "https://schoolshistory.org.uk/topics/european-history/russia-soviet-union/collectivisation-agriculture-stalin/">"collectivized"</a>
        to create large scale farms using modern machinery
        and techniques. The government took the crops from the peasants to feed
        the workers who are working in the cities. Of course, the peasants revolted
        but Stalin deported them and took their lands.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Russia's Industrial Revolution
      </h2>
      <p>Stalin created Five-Year-Plans one after the other.
        Heavy industry was expected to triple its output and light industry was expected to double its output.
        Stalin increased production through the idea of an "uninterrupted week" where everyone worked 7 days a week.
        Stalin created the secret police of internal passports. Harsh and extreme punishment if people are late or absent.
        People were sent to
        <a href= "https://www.history.com/topics/russia/gulag">gulag</a>
        to complete the USSR's idustrial projects.
