        WHY MAKE THEM?
        <!-- code for my intro-->

       <p>
         Friendship bracelets are commonly given as gifts between teens and adults to symbolize eternal friendship and bond. They may take hours to make but it shows your dedication to this relationship. They are more that just strings tied together. They can vary from the loom, thread, color, and embroidery. Trying out colors and embroidery styles of these bracelets are not only fashionable but also beneficial. Making the bracelets would help sharpen your attention and meditate. It helps you pass times and focus on things at hand rather than other stressful factors in your life especially during Covid times. Still not sure why you should start making friendship bracelets take a look

      <h2>CALLING ALL BEGINNERS!
      </h2>
      <!-- code for my p#1-->
      <p>
        Most basic tools
        <br>
        -strings of varying colors--tape and table or clipboard-
        <br>
        For beginners choose strings of different colors, it reduces confusion! As you feel more comfortable with the pattern and the hand movements, you can choose strings of the same color. Might be helpful to have something that is sharp tipped (lead pencil or needles) to undo or untie the knots that are either ugly or a mistake. The most basic or easy pattern to start with for beginners is a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/dTZ58HliYLs">candy-striped or diagonal strip</a>.
        <!--<a href= "url">urltext</a> codes for a link-->
        It requires about 4 strings about 36 inches each. This style is to help you get comfortable with the basic flow of tying the most left string to the right into forwarding knots.

      <h2>
        GETTING FANCY AND COOL!
        <!-- code for my p#2-->
      </h2>
      <p>
        A more complicated pattern than the candy strip is called the
        <a href="https://youtu.be/nNOioNDsg2s">chevron bracelet</a>.
        This style requires about 4 strings of 72 inches each. Fold the strings in half and fasten a knot at the closed end. There should be a loop after you tie your knot. This style creates a letter V shape by tying the outermost left string into the middle using the forward knots and tying the outermost right string into the middle using the backward knots. There is the Chinese ladder bracelet that needs 3 strings. Unlike the chevron and candy-striped, the Chinese ladder uses 1 string and ties the rest of the 2 strings using the forward knot. There is the double basic braid that needs 3 colors, 2 each, in a total of 6 strings. This one is simple and the end results look like braided hair. There is the zig-zag bracelet that requires 4 strings of colors. The colors can be of your choice but for a cool 3D look go to this
        <a href="https://www.momsandcrafters.com/zig-zag-friendship-bracelet/">site</a>.
        That site also teaches you how to tie the knots for the cool patterns as well! There is also the diamond and x style that needs your understanding of the forward knot, backward knot, forward-backward knot, and backward-forward knots. Sounds confusing? Don't stress and take a look
        <a href="https://sarahmaker.com/diamond-friendship-bracelet-pattern/">here</a>.
        There is a standard number of strings you need for each style and embroidery but when you feel comfortable and confident with the styles, you can always add additional strings or even mix the styles together! You can add beads of color or letters to express a message or pattern. Don't be afraid to get fancy! 
        <br> Turn on some calm music and turn off your phone, get your kit of strings, and get started!
